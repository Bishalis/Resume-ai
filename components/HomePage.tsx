              paragraph="Did you know that over 95% of large companies use an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to screen resumes? Before a human recruiter ever sees your application, it's first read and scored by this software. The ATS scans for specific keywords, job titles, and formatting, automatically rejecting any resume that doesn't meet its strict criteria. This means even the most qualified candidates can be filtered out. Our tool simulates how a leading ATS analyses your resume, giving you the power to optimize it for the job you want. We'll help you identify what's missing so you can get past the bots and into the hands of a hiring manager."
